# Flexiv JS

This is an example project showing how you can control a flexiv robot arm with javascript!

Under the hood, the python RDK instance just loads and calls a shared library `.so` file. Because of this, we can easily adapt this same pattern to be used with javascript via Foreign Function Interface (FFI), a mechanism by which a program written in one language can call routines or make use of services written in another.

## Getting started

TODO add getting started ( currently there is a single file under /examples that theoretically could get-robot-states with javascript )
